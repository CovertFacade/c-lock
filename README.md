# toc-toc-ssh

A TOTP based port knocking service. Every time slot, it generates a sequence of ports that must be *knocked* (in a correct order) before the final port (it have been designed for protecting a SSH service) becames opened.

## Installation

### System dependencies

This is the software with wich I have worked:

- `python 3.x`

- `iptables >= v1.6`

It has been tested in *Ubuntu 16.04* and *Debian 9*, but should work with any other system with theese systems installed.

### Software dependencies

As it is just an alpha version, it has no currently an automated installer, because until it comes debugged and improved, it shouldnt have yet integration with the system.

Because `python-cryptography` is needed for some dependencies, it must be installed before anything else: [Building cryptography on linux](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/installation/#building-cryptography-on-linux)

For install dependencies there are two options:

- **Option A**: [Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) (*Recommended*)

```bash
pip3 install pipenv
pipenv install -r requeriments.txt
```

- **Option B**: requeriments.txt

```bash
pip3 install -r requeriments.txt
```

## Usage

First of all, you need to get a secret for initialize the TOTP system:

```
$ python3 server.py --gen-secret
TOTP Secret: 12e76644abf4eb34cf3d163fa058332c610d80d7cbe5b069ee081fb2430126253563b03836b6e1a1
```

Then you can run `server.py` with this secret.

### Server

Must be launch as root (for managing the *iptables* rules):

```
usage: server.py [-h] [-ts SLOT] [-f FORBIDDEN [FORBIDDEN ...]] [-a ADDRESS]
                 [-s SECRET] [-p PROTECTED_PORT] [--gen-secret]
                 [--clean-firewall] [--log-level LOG_LEVEL]

Launch TOTP based port knocking protection

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -ts SLOT, --time-slot SLOT
                        Time slot for TOTP
  -f FORBIDDEN [FORBIDDEN ...], --forbidden FORBIDDEN [FORBIDDEN ...]
                        Ports already in use or not manageable (space
                        separated)
  -a ADDRESS, --address ADDRESS
                        Address to protect
  -s SECRET, --secret SECRET
                        Secret part of TOTP
  -p PROTECTED_PORT, --protected-port PROTECTED_PORT
                        Port which has to be protected
  --gen-secret          Generate random secret
  --clean-firewall      Clean firewall configuration (e.g., after a bad close)
  --log-level LOG_LEVEL
                        Log level
```

The most simple usage is:

```
$ sudo python3 server.py -s 12e76644abf4eb34cf3d163fa058332c610d80d7cbe5b069ee081fb2430126253563b03836b6e1a1

```

### Client

```
usage: client.py [-h] [-ts SLOT] -a ADDRESS -s SECRET

Launch TOTP based port knocking protection

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -ts SLOT, --time-slot SLOT
                        Time slot for TOTP
  -a ADDRESS, --address ADDRESS
                        Address to knock
  -s SECRET, --secret SECRET
                        Secret part of TOTP
```

## Examples

This is how it shows when a client interacts with the server:

## Contributing

By now, and until I finish a first stable version, I want to control the code. The best way of contribute to this project is apporting ideas and reviewing code. Any help is welcome!

For example, its obvious that I need help with documentation images, design, logo... :blush:
